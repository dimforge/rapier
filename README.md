## What is Rapier?

Rapier is a set of 2D and 3D physics engines for games, animation, and robotics. These crates
are `rapier2d`, `rapier3d`, `rapier2d-f64`, and `rapier3d-f64`. They are written with the Rust
programming language, by the [Dimforge](https://dimforge.com) organization. It is forever free
and open-source!

2. Play with the examples: `cargo run --release --bin all_examples2` and `cargo run --release --bin all_examples3`.
   Their source code are available on the `examples2d/` and `examples3d/` directory.
