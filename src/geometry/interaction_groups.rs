#![allow(clippy::bad_bit_mask)] // Clippy will complain about the bitmasks due to Group::NONE being 0.

/// Collision filtering system that controls which colliders can interact with each other.
///
/// Think of this as "collision layers" in game engines. Each collider has:
/// - **Memberships**: What groups does this collider belong to? (up to 32 groups)
/// - **Filter**: What groups can this collider interact with?
///
/// Two colliders interact only if:
/// 1. Collider A's memberships overlap with Collider B's filter, AND
/// 2. Collider B's memberships overlap with Collider A's filter
///
/// # Common use cases
///
/// - **Player vs. Enemy bullets**: Players in group 1, enemies in group 2. Player bullets
///   only hit group 2, enemy bullets only hit group 1.
/// - **Trigger zones**: Sensors that only detect specific object types.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// # use rapier3d::geometry::{InteractionGroups, Group};
/// // Player collider: in group 1, collides with groups 2 and 3
/// let player_groups = InteractionGroups::new(
///     Group::GROUP_1,           // I am in group 1
///     Group::GROUP_2 | Group::GROUP_3  // I collide with groups 2 and 3
/// );
///
/// // Enemy collider: in group 2, collides with group 1
/// let enemy_groups = InteractionGroups::new(
///     Group::GROUP_2,  // I am in group 2
///     Group::GROUP_1   // I collide with group 1
/// );
///
/// // These will collide because:
/// // - Player's membership (GROUP_1) is in enemy's filter (GROUP_1) ✓
/// // - Enemy's membership (GROUP_2) is in player's filter (GROUP_2) ✓
/// assert!(player_groups.test(enemy_groups));
