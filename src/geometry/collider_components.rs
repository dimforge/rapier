        //           - DYNAMIC = 0001
        //           - FIXED = 0010
        //           - KINEMATIC = 1100
        //       These are equal to the bits indexed by `RigidBodyType as u32`.
        //       The bit masks defined by ActiveCollisionTypes are defined is such a way
        //       that the first part of the variant name (e.g. DYNAMIC_*) indicates which
        //       groups of four bits should be considered:
        //           - DYNAMIC_* = the first group of four bits.
        //           - FIXED_* = the second group of four bits.
        //           - KINEMATIC_* = the third and fourth groups of four bits.
        //       The second part of the variant name (e.g. *_DYNAMIC) indicates the value
        //       of the aforementioned groups of four bits.
        //       For example, DYNAMIC_FIXED means that the first group of four bits (because
        //       of DYNAMIC_*) must have the value 0010 (because of *_FIXED). That gives
        //       us 0b0000_0000_0000_0010 for the DYNAMIC_FIXED_VARIANT.
        //
        //       The KINEMATIC_* is special because it occupies two groups of four bits. This is
        //       because it combines both KinematicPositionBased and KinematicVelocityBased.
        //
        //       Now that we have a way of building these bit masks, let's see how we use them.
        //       Given a pair of rigid-body types, the first rigid-body type is used to select
        //       the group of four bits we want to test (the selection is done by to the
        //       `>> (rb_type1 as u32 * 4) & 0b0000_1111`) and the second rigid-body type is
        //       used to form the bit mask we test this group of four bits against.
        //       In other word, the selection of the group of four bits tells us "for this type
        //       of rigid-body I can have collision with rigid-body types with these bit representation".
        //       Then the `(1 << rb_type2)` gives us the bit-representation of the rigid-body type,
        //       which needs to be checked.
        //
        //       Because that test must be symmetric, we perform two similar tests by swapping
        //       rb_type1 and rb_type2.
