/// The collision shape attached to a rigid body that defines what it can collide with.
///
/// Think of a collider as the "hitbox" or "collision shape" for your physics object. While a
/// [`RigidBody`](crate::dynamics::RigidBody) handles the physics (mass, velocity, forces),
/// the collider defines what shape the object has for collision detection.
///
/// ## Key concepts
///
/// - **Shape**: The geometric form (box, sphere, capsule, mesh, etc.)
/// - **Material**: Physical properties like friction (slipperiness) and restitution (bounciness)
/// - **Sensor vs. Solid**: Sensors detect overlaps but don't create physical collisions
/// - **Mass properties**: Automatically computed from the shape's volume and density
///
/// ## Creating colliders
///
/// Always use [`ColliderBuilder`] to create colliders:
///
/// ```ignore
/// let collider = ColliderBuilder::cuboid(1.0, 0.5, 1.0)  // 2x1x2 box
///     .friction(0.7)
///     .restitution(0.3)
///     .build();
/// colliders.insert_with_parent(collider, body_handle, &mut bodies);
/// ```
///
/// ## Attaching to bodies
///
/// Colliders are usually attached to rigid bodies. One body can have multiple colliders
/// to create compound shapes (like a character with separate colliders for head, torso, limbs).
