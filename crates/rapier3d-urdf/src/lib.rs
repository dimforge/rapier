//! ## STL loader for the Rapier physics engine
//!
//! Rapier is a set of 2D and 3D physics engines for games, animation, and robotics. The `rapier3d-urdf`
//! crate lets you convert an URDF file into a set of rigid-bodies, colliders, and joints, for usage with the
//! `rapier3d` physics engine.
//!
//! ## Optional cargo features
//!
//! - `stl`: enables loading STL meshes referenced by the URDF file.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! Are listed below some known limitations you might want to be aware of before picking this library. Contributions to
//! improve
//! these elements are very welcome!
//!
//! - Mesh file types other than `stl` are not supported yet. Contributions are welcome. You my check the `rapier3d-stl`
//! repository for an example of mesh loader.
//! - When inserting joints as multibody joints, they will be reset to their neutral position (all coordinates = 0).
//! - The following fields are currently ignored:
//!     - `Joint::dynamics`
//!     - `Joint::limit.effort` / `limit.velocity`
//!     - `Joint::mimic`
//!     - `Joint::safety_controller`
