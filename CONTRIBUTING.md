## Contributing to the Rust code
The Rust source code of the Rapier physics engines is available  on our `rapier` repository
[on GitHub](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier.rs).

   - Run the tests `cargo test`
   - Run the 2D examples and see if they behave as expected: `cargo run --release --bin all_examples2`
   - Run the 3D examples and see if they behave as expected: `cargo run --release --bin all_examples3`
   - Run the 2D examples with the `parallel` and `simd-stable` features enabled: `cargo run --release --bin all_examples2 --features parallel,simd-stable`
   - Run the 3D examples with the `parallel` and `simd-stable` features enabled: `cargo run --release --bin all_examples3 --features parallel,simd-stable`
4. Once you are satisfied with your changes, submit them by [opening a Pull Request](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier/pulls) on GitHub.
5. If that Pull Request does something you need urgently, or if you think it has been forgotten, don't hesitate

## Contributing to the JavaScript/TypeScript bindings
The source code of the official JavaScript/TypeScript bindings for Rapier are available
on our `rapier.js` repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier.rs).

You will have to make sure that you have [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) installed because
it is responsible for generating the low-level bindings. In order to modify the bindings and test your
changes you may:

1. Fork our `rapier.js` repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier.js).
2. Clone the repository and make the necessary changes.
3. In order to debug your changes and check that it works, do the following for the 3D version of rapier (the procedure
   for the 2D version is similar):
   - `cd rapier3d; npm install; ./build_all.sh`. This will build the JS bindings, TS type definitions, and generate
      the documentation. This will take several minutes to complete.
   - After making changes to the Rust code on that repository, you need to run `./build_rust.sh`.
   - After making changes to the TypeScript code on that repository, you need to run `./build_typescript.sh`.
   - To test your changes, go back to the repository's root directory, and do: `cd testbed3d; npm install; npm link ../rapier3d/pkg; npm run start`.
     This will open the 3D examples on your browser.
   - Our build system for these JS bindings is still a bit messy right now. If you have any trouble, don't
     hesitate to contact us [on Discord][discord].
4. Once you are satisfied with your changes, submit them by [opening a Pull Request](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier.js/pulls) on GitHub.
5. If that Pull Request does something you need urgently, or if you think it has been forgotten, don't hesitate
   to ask **@sebcrozet** directly [on Discord][discord] for a review.
